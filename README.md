Taylor_Solutions_Analysis
=========================

All math majors have to go through undergraduate analysis. At the University of Utah, this takes the form of MATH3210 Foundations of Analysis I, as well as MATH3220 for pure math majors. Our university uses the book "Foundations of Analysis" fr0m the Pure and Applied Undergraduate Texts series of the AMA written by Joseph Taylor, ISBN: 978-0821889848. Unfortunately, no solutions have previously been available.

This repository hopes to remedy this situation by hosting a student written solutions manual. I will be uploading my homework as far as it is correct since I type it up in LaTeX anyways. In my current class we also solve problems during the class period; I hope to type these up and provide them here. Anybody else enrolled in a course using this book: please upload your homework and classwork as well. 

If there are any erros, please do not hesitate to contribute by fixing them.
